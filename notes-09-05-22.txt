training data -> 70% of rows TRAIN MODEL ON THIS
testing data -> 10% of rows 
validation data -> 20% of rows [only used when there are hyper parameters] (used to select the best hyperparameter for a problem)

5,7 -> 89%
5,10 -> 91%
3, 5, 7 -> 94% [WINS] (get 92% using test data)
10,20 -> 85%



Two different types of accuracy
-> training accuracy (how well a trained model performs on the training data) -> 95%
-> testing accuracy ("" "" testing data) -> 85% (All we care about)

s1 traIN 1 DAY -> test accuracy is 70%  // [overfit]
s2 train 1/2 day -> test accuracy is 85% // [underfit]
s3 train 3/4 day -> test accuracy 95%
